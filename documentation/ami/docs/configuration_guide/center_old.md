## Center Properties

To run the ami center, include `center` in the list of components found in the the ami.components property, e.g: `ami.components=center`. By default, all three components are running. 

### General 

`ami.center.port` 
: 
    **Default**: `3270` 
    
    Sets the port of the primary instance of AMI center.

`ami.center.port.bindaddr` 
: 
    **Default**: Optional 

    Specifies the network interface that the `ami.center.port` server port will be bound to.



-   `ami.center.port.bindaddr`: Optional. Specifies the network interface that the *ami.center.port* server port will be bound to
-   `ami.port.whitelist`: Provide either a list of permitted hostname patterns or plugin for blocking/granting access based on foreign network address. Syntax is either file:<file_containing_a_hostname_patterns_per_line\> or text:<newline_delimited_list_of_hostname_patterns> or plugin:<class_name_implementing_com.f1.ami.amicommon.AmiServerSocketEntitlementsPlugin\>
-   `ami.center.ssl.port`: Optionally, sets the secure port that ami center is listening on.
-   `ami.center.ssl.keystore.file`: The path to the key store file, generated using java's keytool.
-   `ami.center.ssl.keystore.password`: The password associated with the key store file
-   `idfountain.path`: The path that is used persist files for managing auto-incrementing ids (amiid)
-   `idfountain.batchsize`: (advanced)  The number of IDs AMI should generate per visit to the physical store.  Larger numbers mean less frequent visits to the file system but result in larger potential id-gaps on restart. Default is 1000000
-   `ami.db.auth.plugin.class`: Class name of custom authenticator which must implement com.f1.ami.web.auth.AmiAuthenticator interface and be deposited in the plugin directory. The plugin will be responsible for user authentication and configuration. See [Custom Java Plugins](../custom_java_plugins/authentication.md) for details.
-   `ami.unknown.realtime.table.behavior`: Defines the behavior when real-time data is streamed into AMI but the type (T="...") values is undefined in the realtime database schema. The default is *LEGACY*.  Permissible values are:  *IGNORE* - drop records and donâ€™t log anything, *LOG_ERROR* - drop records and log a warning, *LEGACY* - insert as a legacy record, *CREATE_TABLE* - Automatically create a new PUBLIC table with the correct columns corresponding to the record's fields and values.
-   `ami.center.publish.changes.period.millis` - How often AMI Center publishes batched data changes out to consumers such as AmiWeb. Default is 500 milliseconds
-   `ami.log.query.max.chars` - By default all queries, along with the username and duration are logged to the server log file. This property controls the max length of a query to get logged before truncating.  If set to 0 then the contents of the query are not logged. If -1 then nothing is logged
-   `ami.center.log.stats.period.millis` - How often stats are appended to the AmiOne.amilog file in milliseconds (default is 15 seconds)
-   `ami.resources.monitor.period.millis` - How often the resources directory is scanned for new/updated files. Default is 5,000 milliseconds

-   `ami.db.timer.logging.enabled`: Default is true, which says that each time a timer is fired a log line will be written to the log file.  In instances where timers are firing frequently, it is optimal to set this to false

### Plugins

-   `ami.object.nobroadcast`: Used to stop a type of message or data from broadcasting to AMI Web.

### Email

To send emails from you account via AMI, you will need to add the some of these properties to local.properties file:

-   `email.client.host`: The SMTP server to connect to. To connect to the Gmail SMTP server use host as smtp.gmail.com
-   `email.client.port`: The SMTP server port to connect to. To connect to the Gmail SMTP server use port as 465.
-   `email.client.username`: Username for the email account.
-   `email.client.password`: Password for the email account.
-   `email.client.authentication.enabled`: If true, attempts to authenticate the user. Defaults to true.
-   `email.client.ssl.enabled`: If true, use SSL to connect and use the SSL port by default. Defaults to false for the SMTP protocol.
-   `email.client.start.tls.enabled`: If true, enables the use of the STARTTLS command (if supported by the server) to switch the connection to a TLS-protected connection before issuing any login commands. If the server does not support STARTTLS, the connection continues without the use of TLS. Defaults to true.
-   `email.client.retries.count`: Number of times it tries to reconnect to the SMTP server. If 0, it will not retry if connection fails. And, for example, if set to 2 it will retry 2 times (so 3 trys in total).
