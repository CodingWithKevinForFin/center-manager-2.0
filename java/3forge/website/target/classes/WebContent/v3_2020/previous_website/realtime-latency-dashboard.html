								<h2 class="h2">The rundown</h2>
								<p>The bank was struggling to display real time trade data in a timely manner and complicated infrastructure changes inhibited their ability to produce comprehensive weekly reports for the senior management. As a result, dashboards would take more than 30 minutes to update and automated report generation stopped working all together. Creating reports manually was too time consuming to consider on a weekly basis. They needed a dashboard that could display larger amounts of data in a chart and a reporting tool flexible enough to adapt to their complex IT infrastructure.

						<p>3Forge AMI enables the ability to display millions of data points in a single chart. Users can zoom in and the resolution is increased in a similar fashion to Google maps. In addition, because of the custom configurability of the data integration layer, all reporting was changed to 3Forge as well. Thanks to the performance and flexibility of 3Forge AMI, the bank supplies their traders with real time dashboards for all of their customer's orders. In addition, aggregated reports are produced in the same dashboards. Now 3Forge AMI is used as one-stop-shop for all reporting and dashboarding for trade latencies.</p>

						<h2 class="h2">The AMI difference</h2>
						<p>3Forge AMI has helped this Tier 1 bank to identify and fix issues that increased latencies at certain times. Once the full set of data was displayed in a single chart, the pattern was recognized and led to a successful investigation of the cause. This has happened several times. In addition, the tool has also allowed them to rapidly respond to customer concerns about trade issues, such as stuck orders, and exceeded their expectations around transparency. Their goal to provide latency statistics to their trade managers and customers is now a reality. As a result, the bank is able to maintain their position as the fastest trading platform on the street.</p>
