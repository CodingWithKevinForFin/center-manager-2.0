This separation makes moving dashboards across environments easier. For example, a datasource may have a particular configuration in the QA environment and a different configuration in Production, but because these details are not stored in the layout, the same layout can easily be used for both. ","\n  "," ","\n  ","In circumstances where the datasource must be stored in the layout, one can use an ","anonymous"," ","datasource"," (see ","ami.db.anonymous.datasources.enabled"," property)","\n  "," ","\n  ","In the frontend datasources can be accessed through ","Dashboard > Data Modeler...
