							<p>Citi is a global investment bank and financial services company. For decades they have helped Traders execute orders through their trading infrastructure. They believe that stability and security are critical features of this service. For almost 10 years, their goal was to reduce the time to and improve the responses to any issues that happen with orders as they are processed through Citi's internal systems. Every attempt to create a solution has failed.</p>

								<h2 class="h2">The rundown</h2>
								<p>Citi was struggling to produce complete audit trails of customer orders as it passed through dozens of internal Citi systems. Internal support staff at Citi would have to log into all of those systems and attempt to correlate an order's path through fuzzy logic and trial and error. This process was expensive, time consuming and error prone. As a result they couldn't answer customer complaints, and couldn't start to address the underlying issues until this was discovered. Customers would call and demand to know what is happening with their orders that were not executed as they expected. Given the time pressure on customers, the delays and inability to answer as to why and where an order was stuck, pushed customers to other providers. They needed a tool that support users could use to answer the customer's question in a matter of seconds, while the customer is on the phone.</p>

						<p>3Forge allows Citi to customize an audit trail tool for their proprietary order ID correlations and OMS architecture. Thanks to 3Forge's query virtualization and reconciliation capabilities, Citi was able to build a dashboard solution for the Citi support staff.  Now Citi uses the 3Forge dashboard to rapidly respond to customer calls. Support staff enters the order information from the customer and immediately the order's audit trail is displayed in a series of tables. Within seconds, Citi can walk through what happened to the order with the customer on the phone and quickly move to resolving the issue. </p>

						<h2 class="h2">The AMI difference</h2>
						<p>3Forge has helped Citi to answer customer complaints in a timely manner. Their goal of reducing the time to and improving the quality of the responses to any issues that happen with orders as they are processed through Citi's internal systems is now complete.  As a result the support teams are not in "spreadsheet hell" as they put it and their customers are very happy with the support.</p>
