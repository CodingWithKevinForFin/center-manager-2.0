The columns can either be predetermined or change dynamically as the underlying data changes. Data can be sorted, filtered, and exported by end users. As users click on rows, they can execute relationships or present menu items. Custom columns can be added when in Layout Editor mode. Tables can also be configured to allow edit mode, where users can double click on row(s) to edit select values.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","Example of a table.","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "],["\n  ","Provides a tree view of data from a datamodel where data is grouped and aggregated up by one or more fields.
