After logging into your AMI portal, enter Layout Editor mode by toggling \n the Layout Editor mode ","to ON ","(found \n on the upper right corner).

This will open up the visualization \n wizard.

Next, you will see all of the tables \n that are accessible in the datasource. Select the table you would like \n to visualize.","\n"," ","\n","\n"," ","\n","9. You will then be taken to the editing \n portion of the Data Modeler. Here, you can 'massage' the data in preparation \n for use in the visualization. If you are ready, click on ","Test",".

In the final portion of the visualization \n wizard, you will select the kind of visualization you would like to create \n in the panel.
